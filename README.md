# University-Progression-Outcome-Predictor

This project is a Python program designed to predict progression outcomes for students based on their credit scores. It was created as coursework for the Principles I module, led by Saman Hettiarachchi.

## Description

The program prompts users to input the number of credits they have achieved at pass, defer, and fail levels. Based on this input, the program determines the progression outcome for the student, which could be progress, module trailer, module retriever, or exclude, as per the university regulations.

## Features

- **Outcome Prediction**: Predicts the progression outcome for individual students based on their credit scores.
- **Validation**: Provides appropriate error messages for incorrect input types, credit ranges, and total credits.
- **Multiple Outcomes**: Allows prediction of progression outcomes for multiple students until the user decides to quit.
- **Histogram**: Generates a histogram showing the distribution of progression outcomes for all students entered.
- **Part 2 (List)**: Extension feature storing input progression data in a list.
- **Part 3 (Text File)**: Extension feature saving input progression data to a text file.
- **Part 4 (Dictionary)**: Extension feature storing input progression data in a dictionary.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Input the credits at pass, defer, and fail levels for each student as prompted.
3. Follow the instructions to continue entering data for additional students or quit to view the results.
4. After quitting, a histogram displaying the distribution of progression outcomes will be shown.
5. Additional features like saving data to a text file or storing data in a dictionary are available as extensions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
